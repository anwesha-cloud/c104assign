# c104assign – Statistical Computations on CSV Data -2022

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a **very old Python assignment-style project** for basic statistical analysis.  
> The code reads numeric data from a CSV file (`Weight.csv`) and computes **mean**, **median**, and **mode** using separate Python scripts.  
> Expect simple logic and possibly outdated coding practices.

This project contains three standalone scripts:
- `mean.py` – Calculates the mean (average) of data values in `Weight.csv`.
- `median.py` – Calculates the median of the data.
- `mode.py` – Calculates the mode of the data.

Each script reads input from `Weight.csv`, performs the calculation, and prints the result. The repository is written in plain Python and is suitable for educational purposes.
